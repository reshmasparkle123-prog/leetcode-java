## 🧮 Approach & Logic

### Emission Factors Used
| Category | Factor |
|---|---|
| Petrol Car | 0.21 kg CO₂/km |
| Diesel Car | 0.17 kg CO₂/km |
| Electric Vehicle | 0.05 kg CO₂/km |
| Motorbike | 0.11 kg CO₂/km |
| Auto Rickshaw | 0.13 kg CO₂/km |
| Bus / Metro | 0.089 kg CO₂/km |
| Train | 0.041 kg CO₂/km |
| Walk / Cycle | 0 kg CO₂/km |
| Electricity (India grid) | 0.82 kg CO₂/kWh |
| Vegan diet | 1.5 kg CO₂/day |
| Vegetarian diet | 2.0 kg CO₂/day |
| Mixed diet | 4.5 kg CO₂/day |
| Heavy meat diet | 7.5 kg CO₂/day |

### Score Grading
| Grade | Range |
|---|---|
| 🌿 Excellent | < 4 kg CO₂/day |
| ✅ Good | 4–8 kg CO₂/day |
| ⚠️ Average | 8–13 kg CO₂/day |
| 🔥 High Impact | > 13 kg CO₂/day |

## 🔒 Security
- **API key server-side only** — Claude API called from `server.js`, never exposed to browser
- Input validation and sanitization on both client and server
- Server-side rate limiting (20 requests/min per IP)
- Client-side rate limiting (15 messages/min)
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-XSS-Protection` headers
- Request body size limited to 10kb
- XSS prevention via `textContent` for all user-generated content

---

## ✅ Testing
Unit tests in `tests/tests.js` — 46 tests covering:
- Transport, food, energy, shopping calculations
- Grade system (Excellent / Good / Average / High Impact)
- Input sanitization and boundary clamping
- Error handling for invalid/malicious inputs
- Real-world Indian user scenarios

```bash
npm test
# or
node tests/tests.js
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Node.js + Express** backend (API proxy)
- **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** frontend (no frameworks)
- **Claude AI** (claude-sonnet-4-6) for AI chat
- `localStorage` for history persistence
- Google Fonts (Space Grotesk + Space Mono)

## 📱 How to Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reshmasparkle123-prog/carbon_lens
cd carbon_lens
npm install
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here npm start
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## 🌍 Assumptions Made
- India's electricity grid emission factor: **0.82 kg CO₂/kWh** (CEA 2023)
- Indian average carbon footprint: **~5.2 kg CO₂/day** (~1.9 tonnes/year)
- AC usage estimated at **0.5 kg CO₂/hour** (standard 1.5-ton split AC)
- Online delivery: **0.5 kg CO₂ per order** (last-mile delivery estimate)
- Food emissions averaged per meal count across the day
